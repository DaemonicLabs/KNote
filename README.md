# KNote
## Setup Instructions
For iOS
1. Check your `gradle --version`.  If nothing shows up, go ahead and install it.
```
brew install gradle
```

2. Once you have your version and you open the project for the first time, you'll want to set your gradle home for importing KNote.

3. You will also need to import sample/build.script.kts
